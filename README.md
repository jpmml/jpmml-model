# Installation #

JPMML-Model library JAR files (together with accompanying Java source and Javadocs JAR files) are released via the Maven Central Repository.

The current version is **1.7.0** (19 January, 2025).

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.jpmml</groupId>
	<artifactId>pmml-model</artifactId>
	<version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>
```

# Usage #

The class model consists of two types of classes. There is a small number of manually crafted classes that are used for structuring the class hierarchy. They are permanently stored in the Java sources directory `/pmml-model/src/main/java`. Additionally, there is a much larger number of automatically generated classes that represent actual PMML elements. They can be found in the generated Java sources directory `/pmml-model/target/generated-sources/xjc` after a successful build operation.

All class model classes descend from the `org.dmg.pmml.PMMLObject` base class. Additional class hierarchy levels, if any, represent common state and/or behaviour. For example, all model classes descend from the `org.dmg.pmml.Model` base class.

The class model should be self-explanatory. The application developer is advised to consult with the latest [PMML specification](https://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html) about the specifics of individual PMML elements and attributes.

### Unmarshalling ###

Loading a PMML schema version 3.X or 4.X document into a live `org.dmg.pmml.PMML` object:

```java
public PMML load(InputStream is) throws SAXException, JAXBException {
	return org.jpmml.model.PMMLUtil.unmarshal(is);
}
```

**Important**: It is the responsibility of the application developer to ensure that the XML document does not contain malicious content (eg. XEE and XXE attacks).

### Applying visitors ###

Deleting SAX Locator information from the class model:

```java
public void optimize(PMML pmml){
	var visitor = new org.jpmml.model.visitors.LocatorNullifier();

	visitor.applyTo(pmml);
}
```

### Marshalling ###

Storing a live `org.dmg.pmml.PMML` object into a PMML schema version 4.4 document:

```java
public void store(PMML pmml, OutputStream os) throws JAXBException {
	org.jpmml.model.PMMLUtil.marshal(pmml, os);
}
```
